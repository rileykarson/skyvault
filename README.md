# Skyvault

Skyvault is a 2D game made during CISC 226, Game Design.

Our goal with Skyvault was to create a puzzle-platformer game, in the vein of Portal, except by using a tool more similar to Half Life 2's Gravity Gun. We wanted it to feel like a polished game with accurate hitboxes, modular challenges spread across the levels, and immersive sound effects.

In Skyvault, the protagonist, Tammy, needs to free the last known ferret from the menacing Alexis Tarnouskov. She knows that it's holed up with him in the vaults of his massive space station - the "Skyvault".
